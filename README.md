# HoursDashboard

A React-based weekly hours dashboard built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, allowing users to input and update their work hours, break durations, and view real-time calculations of total hours, gross pay, tax, and net pay. Data is stored in **MongoDB** via **Mongoose**. The app is fully tested using **React Testing Library** and **Jest**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🗓 Displays work hours for a full week (Monday–Sunday)
- ✏️ Editable start time, end time, and break duration
- 📊 Automatically calculates:
  - Total hours (adjusted for breaks)
  - Gross pay (based on hourly rate per day)
  - Estimated tax (~15%)
  - Net pay (after tax)
- 💾 MongoDB backend with Mongoose for persistence
- ✅ Unit tested with React Testing Library

## 💵 Pay Calculation Logic

- **Total Hours** = `(end - start - break) / 60`
- **Gross Pay** = `total hours × hourly rate`
- **Tax** = `~15% of gross pay`
- **Net Pay** = `gross pay - tax`

Values are recalculated dynamically whenever the user modifies the break duration or time fields.

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## ✅ Example Test Case

<pre> ```js test("updates total hours and net pay on break change", () => { render(<HoursDashboard weekData={mockWeekData[0]} onSave={jest.fn()} />); const mondayRow = screen.getByTestId("row-Monday"); const breakInput = within(mondayRow).getByDisplayValue("30"); fireEvent.change(breakInput, { target: { value: "60" } }); expect(within(mondayRow).getByText("7.00")).toBeInTheDocument(); // Total hours expect(within(mondayRow).getByText("$21.04")).toBeInTheDocument(); // Tax expect(within(mondayRow).getByText("$118.96")).toBeInTheDocument(); // Net }); ``` </pre>
